Hi! You can find descriptions and links to my projects here!

# [My Dotfiles](https://github.com/theopn/dotfiles)

Well, it really isn't a project, isn't it? But this might be the repository where I spend most of my time committing. This repository includes configurations for text editors like Vim, Neovim, and Emacs (Vim is better!), zsh, kitty, tmux, and other terminal/shell related programs, i3 & Polybar and Sway & Waybar, and absolute weirdos like Mutt and w3m.

# [AwesomeWM](https:/theopark.me)

In progress! I am creating my custom desktop environment using Lua, AwesomeWM framework, and shell scripts to integrate the dynamic tiling window manager with other essential tools.
