# Hi! My name is Theo, and I do... a lot of different things.

## Academics

I am a student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) studying [computer science](https://catalog.purdue.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=14&poid=18776) and [philosophy](https://catalog.purdue.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=14&poid=18803). When I was in middle school, I would collect ISO files for old operating systems, (shout out to [WinWorld](https://winworldpc.com/)), install them on virtual machines, and be fascinated by not only the OS themselves but the installation processes. While I did not have a coding background besides a little bit of C from [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), I knew I loved playing with computers. This turns out to be true, and I enjoy studying computer science. My favorite courses include CS18000: OOP, CS182: Discrete math for CS, CS240: C Programming, but my all time favorite is MA351: Linear algebra with Professor Sinclair.

I also like writing and math, particularly logics and discrete math, which me majoring in philosophy along with the influence from my dad.

Outside of the school work, I am a member of [Undergraduate Student Board](https://purdueusb.com/) for the computer science department.

## Career

My love for teaching is well reflected on some of my past and current jobs. I worked as a undergraduate teaching assistant for [CS18000: Problem Solving and Objected-Oriented Programming](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/academic-programs/courses/canonical/cs180.html) since the second semester of the freshman year to the following summer. I also worked as a course content developer over the same summer, developing homework, projects, and exams for CS180 using JUnit framework.

In the fall semester of the sophomore year, I will be working as a lecturer for [CS193000: Tools](https://selfservice.mypurdue.purdue.edu/prod/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=202010&subj_code_in=CS&crse_numb_in=19300), teaching 800+ computer science and data science freshmen CS tools such as Git, \*nix shell and commands, and Vim.

## More about me

I love messing with shell, particularly different text editors, but I always come back to Vim and Neovim. Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/theopn/dotfiles) for the vim/Nvim configuration. 

I love taking photos. I own Canon EOS M50 with EF-M 15-45mm f/3.5-6.3 lens, and I have taken many portraits with it. Maybe one day I will share my photos online.

I am colorblind.

I love writing, despite being not particularly good at it.

I love salmon.

I love organization and cleaning.
