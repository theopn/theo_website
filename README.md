This is where all the source files for my website, powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I use [terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme for Hugo, and to make sure everything is up to date, 
I recommend you (likely future me) to delete `themes/terminal` directory and re-clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal.git themes/terminal
`. [My website](https://theopn.github.io/) is hosted by GitHub.
